	<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">America has been slowly collapsing into cartels and oligopolies as it's society has further stratified into a class system where the wealthy leverage their position and influence to further the class system and accrue equity without reinvesting it into the economy, this situation can mainly be attributed to the laxity and manipulation of the media. Hiding the corruption various individuals cause since the majority of the populous is distracted with their lives and the "circuses" put on by the media, COVID has changed that. The COVID lockdown has ground people's lives to a crawl, prevented them from engaging in hobbies, and given them the time to actually look at the world while their savings slip through their fingers.

<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">
	This brings us to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">/r/WallStreetBets</a> and the "short squeeze," the environment described earlier has caused a series of unique events to unfold in January 2021 around Gamestop and less prominently: BlockBuster, Bed Bath & Beyond, and AMC that has brought what some might call <i>economic warfare</i> carried out by hedge funds to public awareness.
	The actions of these hedge funds actively damaged the equity of not only the stockholders but furthered the wealth inequality in America, a stellar example of how the middle class is dissolving only to leave the lower and upper class; Since the 1990's the class divide has become more pronounced, with the top 10% of the American income bracket accruing ~80% of America's total wealth equity, while the bottom 50% of the American income bracket only possess ~1% of America's total wealth equity. Let that sink in, the bottom 50% of earner's own so little it can be erased with a rounding error.

<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">
	The short squeeze is the concerted effort of various reddit users betting against these hedge funds on the stock market, investing into Gamestop, BlockBuster, Bed Bath & Beyond, and AMC to force the hedgefunds to pay the market price for the stocks they leveraged. Which has caused quite the ruckus, the burgeoning cartels and oligopolies that rely upon these hedge funds to: fix prices, prevent outside interference, and manipulate economic futures are in danger of shrinking or collapsing since their revenue streams are being restricted after using the pandemic to expand. Indeed, while people were losing their livelihoods and loved ones these cooperatives increased their equity by ~30% and were in the midst of further growth as they harvested the equity others had to liquidate to survive the pandemic.
</p>
<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">
	The short squeeze is not the end of this situation, however, it is a worthy landmark. A landmark that marks the beginning of a new era of choices that America's politicians and legislators must make, and whether or not these elected officials are serving in the best interests of their constituents or that of the lobbyists and billionaires. A conundrum for our elected elites since their campaigns and livelihoods are mostly supported by these interests and play a major role in getting them elected into office, whereas if they do not they risk losing their constituents who seek out politicians with their interests in mind. I believe their metric of decision making will revolve around whether they have already siphoned sufficient funds through their position to retire comfortably among their wealth, and their fear of the populace being despondent enough to "Eat the Rich" because of the damage that has been done.
</p>

<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">
	No matter what happens though we all will are living in interesting times, and only the future will tell whether we come out of them whole.
